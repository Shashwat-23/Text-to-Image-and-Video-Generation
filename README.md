__**Text to Image and Video Generation Project :**__

Welcome to the Text-to-Image and Video Generation project for Upscaled Image Resolution using the EDSR4x algorithm. This project focuses on enhancing image resolution by a factor of 4 using the Efficient Deep Super-Resolution (EDSR) model, resulting in high-quality images with a resolution of 2048 x 2048 pixels. Additionally, this project includes functionality for text-to-image and video generation, allowing users to convert textual descriptions into realistic images and videos.

__**Features :**__

*Image Upscaling with EDSR4x*:

1)Utilizes the EDSR4x algorithm to enhance the resolution of input images by a factor of 4.
2)Achieves a final image resolution of 2048 x 2048 pixels.
3)Improves image quality and details for a more visually appealing output.

*Text-to-Image Generation:*:

1)Converts textual descriptions into realistic images using state-of-the-art image generation techniques.
2)Enables users to provide textual prompts and generate corresponding images.

*Video Generation*:

1)Extends the text-to-image generation to create dynamic video content.
2)Allows users to input a sequence of textual descriptions to generate a coherent video story.
